            <h2> CSS Basics</h2>
            <h3>What are the main differences between external, internal, and inline CSS?</h3>
            <p><strong>External CSS</strong>, where the css file is linked to in the <code>head</code>, can be used to
                style
                multiple pages
                linked to one
                CSS file, so it can serve as the style rules
                for multiple pages.<br>
                <strong>Internal CSS</strong>, where the css is contained within a <code>style</code> tag in the
                <code>head</code>, can be
                used to style
                the elements on that page only.<br>
                <strong>Inline CSS</strong>, where styles are defined within an element's tag, can only be used to style
                individual elements
                one at a time.
            </p>
            <h3>What is the syntax for class and ID selectors?</h3>
            <p>Class selectors are accessed using <code>.classname</code> and ID selectors are accessed using
                <code>#idname</code>.
            </p>
            <h3>How would you apply a single rule to two different selectors?</h3>
            <p>You can apply the same rule to multiple elements by putting a comma between them
            <pre>
                <code>.firstclass, .secondclass {
                    color: #FF0000;
                    }</code></pre>
            This will apply the color to both the .firstclass and .secondclass.
            </p>
            <h3>Given an element that has an id of title and a class of primary, how would you use both attributes for a
                single rule?</h3>
            <p>You can chain the selectors together to apply one rule:
            <pre>
                <code>#title.primary {
                    color: #000000;
                    }</code></pre>
            This will only select the element that has both the #title id and the .primary class.
            </p>
            <h3>What does the descendant combinator do?</h3>
            <p>The descendant combinator can select an element that is the child or descendant of a specific parent or
                ancestor.
            <pre><code>.parent .child {
                color: #FF000;
                } </code></pre>
            The ancestor goes first, then a
            space, then the descendant.
            </p>
            <div class="list-container">
                <ul>
                    <li>descendant selector (space)</li>
                    <li>child selector (>)</li>
                    <li>adjacent sibling selector (+)</li>
                    <li>general sibling selector (~)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>
            <h3>Between a rule that uses one class selector and a rule that uses three type selectors, which rule has
                the
                higher specificity?</h3>
            <p>The class selector rule would be applied first as it takes precedence over any number of type selectors.
            </p>

            <h2>Block and Inline Elements</h2>
            <h3>What is the difference between a block element and an inline element?</h3>
            <p>A block element will break normal flow and always sit on its own line, where an inline element will
                remain in
                the normal flow of the page.</p>
            <h3>What is the difference between an inline element and an inline-block element?</h3>
            <p>An inline element can only have its width adjusted, where an inline-block element can adjust both width
                and
                height.</p>
            <h3>What does the <code>box-sizing</code> css property do?</h3>
            <p>The box-sixing property can affect whether the width and height of an element refer to its contents only,
                or
                also include the padding.</p>
            <h3>Is an <code>h1</code> block or inline?</h3>
            <p>H1, h2, and all other header elements are block elements.</p>
            <h3>Is <code>span</code> block or inline?</h3>
            <p>Span is an inline element.</p>
            <h3>Is <code>button</code> block or inline?</h3>
            <p>Buttons are block elements.</p>
            <h3>Is <code>div</code> block or inline?</h3>
            <p>Divs are block elements.</p>
            <h3>Would you use <code>margin</code> or <code>padding</code> to create more space between 2 elements?</h3>
            <p>Margins affect the space between elements.</p>
            <h3>Would you use <code>margin</code> or <code>padding</code> to create more space between the contents of
                an
                element and its border?</h3>
            <p>Padding affects the space between an elements contents and its border.</p>

        <section id="resets">
            <h2>CSS Resets</h2>
            <h3>Why would you want to use a CSS reset?</h3>
            <p>CSS resets are used to override the various browsers' default styles so that a website looks the same on
                different browers.</p>
        </section>


        <section id="units">
            <h2>CSS Units</h2>
            <h3>Why would you want to use <code>em</code> or <code>rem</code> for font-size instead of px?</h3>
            <p>I would not use <code>em</code> for font size, because each nested element using <code>em</code> could
                end up
                getting bigger and bigger. I would use <code>rem</code> as the font size would remain consistent to the
                body
                font size, and would be more responsive than using <code>px</code>.</p>
            <h3>What are some instances where you might want to use <code>vh</code> and <code>vw</code>?</h3>
            <p>These units are good for setting the size of elements relative to the size of the viewport, such as a
                hero
                section or even sidebar.</p>
            <h3>What are some instances where you might want to use <code>px</code> instead of a relative unit?</h3>
            <p>It could be beneficial to use <code>px</code> for padding and margin for smaller elements such as buttons
                or
                small card-like components, but I would use <code>em</code> for larger elements to keep the space
                consistent
                with the element font size.</p>

            <h2>Text Styles</h2>
            <h3>What are the 2 ways to add fonts that are not installed on a user's computer?</h3>
            <p>The easiest way is to use an external API such as Google Fonts, where the font can be linked in the head
                of
                the HTML or imported into the first line of CSS.<br>
                Another way - which often loads faster - is to download a font and import it into your CSS via url using
                <code>@font-face</code>.
            <pre><code>@font-face {
            font-family: cool-font;
            src: url(../fonts/cool-font-file.woff);
                  }</code></pre>
            </p>
            <h3>What is the "system font stack" and why would you want to use it?</h3>
            <p>The system font stack lists several common fonts, and the browser will display the first one the user has
                installed
                on their computer. This is a good way to avoid using the brower's default font, which may not match your
                design.</p>
            <h3>Which property would you use to increase or decrease the space between letters in a word?</h3>
            <p>To increase the space between letters in a word, use the <code>letter-spacing</code> property.</p>
            <h3>Which property would you use to increase or decrease the space between lines in a paragraph?</h3>
            <p>To increase the space between lines of text vertically, use the <code>line-height</code> property.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="properties">
            <h2>More CSS Properties</h2>
            <h3>Which property would you use to make an element transparent?</h3>
            <p>
                The <code>opacity</code> property is used to make an element transparent, for example
                <code>opacity: 0.5;</code> would make an element 50% opaque.
            </p>
            <h3>Which property would you use to make a background image tile?</h3>
            <p>
                To make a background image tile, add <code>repeat</code> to the <code>background</code> shorthand
                property,
                or set it
                specifically using
                <code>background-repeat: repeat</code>. Setting <code>background-repeat: no-repeat</code> will prevent
                the
                background image from tiling.
            </p>
            <h3>Which property would you use to add scrollbars to an element?</h3>
            <p>If the content of an element is overflowing it's container, use <code>overflow: scroll</code> to give the
                container a scrollbar. This will apply on both the x and y axis.</p>
            <h3>Which property would you use to add a shadow behind an element?</h3>
            <p><code>box-shadow</code> is used to add a shadow behind an element; it typically is used with four values,
                offset-x, offset-y, blur-radius, and a colour.e.g.
                <code>2px 2px 4px black</code> would add 2px to the right, 2px to the bottom, and 4px of blur in
                <code>black</code>. Using negative values would, for example, shift the offset-x to the left instead of
                the
                right.
            </p>
            <h3>Which property would you use to create rounded corners on an element?</h3>
            <p>To round the corners of an element, use <code>border-radius</code>. Using this with a single value will
                round
                all corners to the same size, or all the corners can be set to different radius values.</p>
            <h3>How would you use border-radius to make a circular element?</h3>
            <p>To create a circular element, the element must be a square with the same height and width, then use
                <code>border-radius: 50%</code> to round all the corners into a circle.

        <section id="selectors">

            <h2>More Selectors</h2>
            <h3>What is the difference between the child combinator and the descendant combinator?</h3>
            <p>The child combinator <code>.parent > .child</code> selects the <em>direct</em> child of an element, the
                descendant
                combinator <code>.parent .child</code> will select <em>any child or grandchild</em> of an element.</p>
            <h3>How does the syntax of pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements differ?</h3>
            <p>Pseudo classes are targeted with one colon <code>:</code>, pseudo-elements are targeted with two colons
                <code>::</code>.
            </p>
            <h3>Do pseudo-classes exist somewhere in HTML? Do pseudo-elements?</h3>
            <p>Pseudo-classes do exist in HTML. Pseudo-elements do not, and are only generated by the CSS for display
                purposes.</p>
            <h3>Name two ways you could select every second child of an element, starting with the first.</h3>
            <p>
            <ol>
                <li><code>element:nth-child(2)</code></li>
                <li><code>element:nth-child(2n+1)</code></li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <h3>What is the difference between <code>div:first-child</code> and <code>div :first-child</code>? What will
                each select?</h3>
            <p>
                <code>div:first-child</code> will select the first <code>div</code>.<br>
                <code>div :first-child</code> will select the first element that is the child of a <code>div</code>.
            </p>
            <h3>What selector would you use to style a button a user is currently hovering over? How about one that is
                currently being clicked on?</h3>
            <p>Style a button that is being hovered over with <code>button:hover</code> and a button that is being
                clicked
                with <code>button:active</code>.</p>
            <h3>How could you select all input elements with a type of text?</h3>
            <p><code>input[type="text"]</code> will select every <code>input</code> with the attribute <code>type</code>
                with a value
                of <code>text</code>.</p>
            <h3>How could you select all classes that begin with <code>thunder</code> ?</h3>
            <p><code>class^="thunder"]</code>, where the caret (^) after the attribute targets any element
                <em>beginning</em> with the characters that follow. Similarly <code>$</code> targets text that ends in
                those
                characters, and <code>*</code> will target the characters anywhere in the attribute.

        <section id="positioning">

            <h2>Positioning</h2>
            <h3>What is the difference between static and relative positioning?</h3>
            <p>
                Static is the default <code>position</code> property, these elements just follow the normal flow of the
                html
                document. <br>
                Relative positioning also follows the normal flow, but an element with <code>position: relative</code>
                can also be moved <em>relative to it's own position</em> in normal flow, without affecting the other
                elements - they behave as if the element was still where it's supposed to be. Positioning is done the
                the <code>top</code>, <code>left</code>, <code>bottom</code>, and <code>right</code> properties, set to
                any value in
                absolute or relative units eg 10px, 1em, etc.
            </p>

            <h3>What is absolute positioning useful for?</h3>
            <p>
                An element with <code>position: absolute</code> can be positioned relative to the next parent element
                set to <code>position: relative</code> or <code>absolute</code>. If there isn't one, the element will be
                positioned relative to the html element. These elements are removed from normal flow and other elements
                will behave as if it was never there.
            </p>

            <h3>What is the difference between fixed and sticky positioning?</h3>
            <p>
                A fixed element is positioned relative to the viewport, and will stay in view even when the page is
                scrolled. A sticky element will also stay in place, but only while it's parent is in view. Once the
                parent has scrolled out of view, the sticky element will scroll away with it.
            </p>

            <h2>CSS Functions</h2>

            <h3>What are the four CSS math functions we covered above?</h3>
            <div class="list-container">
                <ul>
                    <li><code>calc()</code>: for performing basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
                        Can
                        be used to dynamically size elements or fonts based on the size of other elements, or custom
                        properties (variables).</li>
                    <li><code>min()</code>: used for sizing an element or font, and can take several values in different
                        units, e.g. <code>min(50%, 400px)</code>. As the browser is resized, <code>min()</code> will
                        use whichever
                        value is <strong>smallest</strong>.</li>
                    <li><code>max()</code>: like <code>min()</code>, but will take whichever value is
                        <strong>largest</strong>.
                        <code>min()</code> and <code>max()</code> can both also perform basic math.
                    </li>
                    <li><code>clamp()</code>: takes three values - the minimum, ideal, and maximum. The element will
                        never be smaller than it's lowest value, or larger than it's highest value. </li>
                </ul>
            </div>



            <h3>How do we use CSS math functions in our CSS?</h3>
            <p>
                CSS math functions are primarily used for sizing, which can provide an alternative to using media
                queries.
            </p>

            <h3>How can CSS functions help make websites and applications more responsive?</h3>
            <p>CSS functions are useful for responsive design because sizing properties such as <code>height</code>,
                <code>font-size</code>, <code>padding</code>, etc. can be calculated based on the size of other elements
                or of the viewport, without having to hard-code all the properties.

            <h2>Custom Properties</h2>

            <h3>How would you declare a custom property with a name of text-color?</h3>
            <p>First create a variable name, starting with two hyphens, and set it to any valid CSS value.</p>
            <pre><code>
            .class {
                 --text-color: #000;
            }
                    </code></pre>

            <h3>How would you access a custom property with a name of background-color?</h3>
            <p>Access the custom property by calling the variable as a value to a CSS property.</p>
            <pre><code>
            .class {
                background-color: var(--background-color);
            }
                </code></pre>

            <h3>Where would you declare a custom property to have its scope be global and accessible by all other
                selectors?</h3>
            <p>To create a global custom property, create it in the <code>:root</code> element (which is similar to the
                <code>html</code> element but with higher
                precedence). To scope the custom property to a specific class or element, create it within that class or
                element. It cannot be used anywhere else.
            </p>

            <h3>Where would you declare a custom property so that a user's theme setting from their OS or browser was
                taken into account?</h3>
            <p>A media query, such as <code>prefers-color-scheme</code>, which can detect if the user has dark mode
                set and the custom property will be applied accordingly.
            </p>

            <h2>Frameworks & Preprocessors</h2>

            <h3>What are some advantages of using a CSS framework?</h3>
            <p>CSS frameworks such as Tailwind and Bootstrap make it quick and easy to code UI for websites and
                applications, even
                without design skills. They can also make it easy for a team to collaborate because everyone is using
                the same code.</p>

            <h3>What are some disadvantages of using a CSS framework?</h3>
            <p>CSS frameworks can be difficult to debug, especially if you're using one because your own CSS skills are
                not that strong. They can also be complicated to customise as the framework needs to be overrided.
                Finally, frameworks can cause a lot of websites to look the same, if developers are all using the same
                frameworks.</p>

            <h3>What are some advantages of using a CSS preprocessor?</h3>
            <p>CSS preprocessors such as Sass and Stylus can make it easy to write more powerful CSS using features such
                as mixins, variables, and loops. One helpful feature is nesting your CSS meaning you don't have to worry
                as much about knowing all the different kinds of selectors.<br>
                Preprocessors also make your processed CSS code DRY-er, and more organised - meaning it is easier to
                read and understand by other developers.</p>

            <h3>What are some disadvantages of using a CSS preprocessor?</h3>
            <p>The output CSS can be difficult to debug as it doesn't exactly match what was input.<br>
                Having to learn and set up additional tools can take up too much extra time.<br>
                CSS now includes solutions to some of the problems that preprocessors were invented to solve, such as
                variables and mixins.<br>
                Once a project has been built with a preprocessor, it can be difficult to remove it.
