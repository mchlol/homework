            <h2>Asking for Help</h2>

            <h3>Name at least one thing your question should always include. </h3>
            <p>Always include your code, and the specific issue you are having e.g. ‘I’m trying to return a string when
                this condition is reached but I get a syntax error on line 15.” Also include what you have already tried
                that didn't work.</p>

            <h3>Describe the “XY Problem”.</h3>
            <p>The XY problem is when someone needs help with X, and thinks they can figure it out by doing Y - but they
                don’t know how to do Y either, so they ask for help with Y instead of just asking for help with X.</p>

            <h3>Describe three attributes of a “help vampire”.</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Asking for help when they clearly haven't even tried to solve the issue themselves (ie. being lazy).
                </li>
                <li>Asking for help on something many other people have already asked, instead of just Googling/looking
                    at those questions and answers.</li>
                <li>Asking vague or broad questions and providing no code or context (again being lazy).</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>How Does the Web Work?</h2>
            <h3>What is a network?</h3>
            <p>A network is a group of computers all connected together via a router.</p>

            <h3>What is the internet?</h3>
            <p>The internet is a global structure of networks.</p>

            <h3>What is an IP address?</h3>
            <p>
                An IP or Internet Protocol address is a unique series of numbers that identifies a computer linked to a

            </p>

            <h3>What is a router?</h3>
            <p>
                A router is a computer that serves to connect a group of computers together, rather than have each
                computer
                individually connect to every other computer.
            </p>

            <h3>What is an ISP?</h3>

                routers, enabling customers to access the internet.</p>

            <h3>What are packets and how are they used to transfer data?</h3>
            <p>
                Packets are the smaller chunks of website data that are broken up and sent individually - this allows
                multiple users to download the same website at once, and it loads much faster.
            </p>

            <h3>What is a client?</h3>
            <p>A client is your computer, phone, smartfridge, or whatever else you use to access the internet.</p>

            <h3>What is a server?</h3>
            <p>
                A server is a computer that stores the files that make up web pages or apps. When a user wants to view a
                website they download a copy of it from the server to their client.
            </p>

            <h3>What is a web page?</h3>
            <p>
                A web page is a document that consists of code (such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and assets (images
                and
                other media files).
            </p>

            <h3>What is a web server?</h3>
            <p>A web server is a computer that hosts the files that make up a webpage on the internet.</p>

            <h3>What is a web browser?</h3>
            <p>A web browsers is software that parses the code that makes up websites and displays them.</p>

            <h3>What is a search engine?</h3>
            <p>A search engine is a service that finds other web pages.</p>

            <h3>What is a DNS request?</h3>
            <p>
                A DNS or domain name server request, takes the human readable name of a web address and finds the
                corresponding numbers of the IP address that point to that page.
            </p>

            <h3>Which browser are you currently using?</h3>
            <p>Google Chrome 100.0 (as of May '22).</p>

            <h3>In your own words, explain what happens when you run a search on google.com.</h3>
            <p>
                When a user enters a search term on google.com, Google’s machines search its index for most relevant
                results, based on the keywords used, the user’s location, the device they’re using, and hundreds of
                other
                factors, in order to provide the user with the best results.
