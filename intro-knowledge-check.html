            <h2>Asking for Help</h2>

            <h3>Name at least one thing your question should always include. </h3>
            <p>Always include your code, and the specific issue you are having e.g. ‘I’m trying to return a string when
                this condition is reached but I get a syntax error on line 15.” Also include what you have already tried
                that didn't work.</p>

            <h3>Describe the “XY Problem”.</h3>
            <p>The XY problem is when someone needs help with X, and thinks they can figure it out by doing Y - but they
                don’t know how to do Y either, so they ask for help with Y instead of just asking for help with X.</p>

            <h3>Describe three attributes of a “help vampire”.</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Asking for help when they clearly haven't even tried to solve the issue themselves (ie. being lazy).
                </li>
                <li>Asking for help on something many other people have already asked, instead of just Googling/looking
                    at those questions and answers.</li>
                <li>Asking vague or broad questions and providing no code or context (again being lazy).</li>

            <h2>How Does the Web Work?</h2>
            <h3>What is a network?</h3>
            <p>A network is a group of computers all connected together via a router.</p>

            <h3>What is the internet?</h3>
            <p>The internet is a global structure of networks.</p>

            <h3>What is an IP address?</h3>
            <p>
                An IP or Internet Protocol address is a unique series of numbers that identifies a computer linked to a
                network. A domain name is a human-readable IP address.
            </p>

            <h3>What is a router?</h3>
            <p>
                A router is a computer that serves to connect a group of computers together, rather than have each
                computer
                individually connect to every other computer.
            </p>

            <h3>What is an ISP?</h3>
            <p>An ISP, or Internet Service Provider, is a company that manages routers that connect to other ISP's
                routers, enabling customers to access the internet.</p>

            <h3>What are packets and how are they used to transfer data?</h3>
            <p>
                Packets are the smaller chunks of website data that are broken up and sent individually - this allows
                multiple users to download the same website at once, and it loads much faster.
            </p>

            <h3>What is a client?</h3>
            <p>A client is your computer, phone, smartfridge, or whatever else you use to access the internet.</p>

            <h3>What is a server?</h3>
            <p>
                A server is a computer that stores the files that make up web pages or apps. When a user wants to view a
                website they download a copy of it from the server to their client.
            </p>

            <h3>What is a web page?</h3>
            <p>
                A web page is a document that consists of code (such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and assets (images
                and
                other media files).
            </p>

            <h3>What is a web server?</h3>
            <p>A web server is a computer that hosts the files that make up a webpage on the internet.</p>

            <h3>What is a web browser?</h3>
            <p>A web browsers is software that parses the code that makes up websites and displays them.</p>

            <h3>What is a search engine?</h3>
            <p>A search engine is a service that finds other web pages.</p>

            <h3>What is a DNS request?</h3>
            <p>
                A DNS or domain name server request, takes the human readable name of a web address and finds the
                corresponding numbers of the IP address that point to that page.
            </p>

            <h3>Which browser are you currently using?</h3>
            <p>Google Chrome 100.0 (as of May '22).</p>

            <h3>In your own words, explain what happens when you run a search on google.com.</h3>
            <p>
                When a user enters a search term on google.com, Google’s machines search its index for most relevant
                results, based on the keywords used, the user’s location, the device they’re using, and hundreds of
                other
                factors, in order to provide the user with the best results.

            <h2>Problem Solving</h2>

            <h3>What are the three stages in the problem solving process?</h3>
            <p>Understanding the problem, planning how to solve the problem, and breaking the problem down into smaller,
                subproblems.</p>

            <h3>Why is it important to clearly understand the problem first?</h3>
            <p>If you don't understand the problem, you won't know where to start, could waste a lot of time on the
                wrong things, and confuse
                yourself even further in the process.</p>

            <h3>What can you do to help get a clearer understanding of the problem?</h3>
            <p>Break it down into smaller subproblems, and try to solve those first. "<a
                    href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2/"
                    target="blank">This technique is the cornerstone of problem-solving.</a>" - Richard Reis.</p>

            <h3>What are some of the things you should do in the planning stage of the problem solving process?</h3>
            <p>Draw a sketch of the interface, draw diagrams, write pseudocode, explain the project to someone else
                (like '<a href="https://rubberduckdebugging.com/" target="_blank">rubber duck
                    debugging</a>').<br>
                Make sure that you fully understand what it is you're trying to achieve, and break it down into steps.
            </p>

            <h3>What is an algorithm?</h3>
            <p>An algorithm is the series of steps taken to accomplish a task.</p>

            <h3>What is pseudocode?</h3>
            <p>
                Pseudocode is the instructions or steps that a program will take to accomplish a task, but it's just
                written in normal language, for humans to read instead of actual code.
            </p>

            <h3>What are the advantages of breaking a problem down and solving the smaller problems?</h3>
            <p>
                Looking at one large problem can seem like an insurmountable task. Breaking it down into smaller
                sub-problems means you can focus on each small part at a time, making things clearer and easier.

            <h2>Understanding Errors</h2>

            <h3>What are three reasons why you may see a TypeError?</h3>
            <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Passing a variable of one type to a function which is expecting a different type.</li>
                <li>Trying to modify a value that can't be changed, e.g. reassigning a const</li>
                <li>Trying to use a value in an inappropriate way, e.g. using an array method on a string.</li>
            </ol>
            </p>

            <h3>What is the key difference between an error and a warning?</h3>
            <p>A warning will still allow your code to run, but will warn you of a problem. An error will cause your
                code not to run at all.</p>

            <h3>What is one method you can use to resolve an error?</h3>
            <p>Use the debugger in your browser, use console.log, or put a <code>debugger;</code> in your code where the
                error is occuring. In this way you can follow the steps of your code and see <strong>what you actually
                    told it to do</strong>, vs what you <em>think</em> you told it to do.</p>

            <h2>Clean Code</h2>

            <h3>Why is it important to write clean code?</h3>
            <p>
                It's important to write clean code so that other developers (and future you) can read it easily and
                understand what it does.
            </p>

            <h3>Name 5 clean code principles previously mentioned</h3>
            <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Plan out your code before you write it so it doesn't turn into impossible-to-read spaghetti.</li>
                <li>Use indentation, and use it consistently - it will go a long way to making your code easier to
                    understand for the
                    next person (or your future self).</li>
                <li>Break up large functions into smaller ones.</li>
                <li>Use standard naming conventions - e.g. starting variables with nouns and functions with verbs, using
                    camelCase, and </li>
                <li>Don't overuse comments, your code should be reasonably self explanatory.</li>
            </ol>
            </p>

            <h3>What is the difference between good comments and bad comments?</h3>
            <p>Good comments are concise and to the point, allowing the developer reading it to get a quick extra
                bit of knowledge about that piece of code.<br>
                Bad comments are things like leaving a note to self, blaming someone else for writing a piece of
                code, or being vague. </p>
