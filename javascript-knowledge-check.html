            <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>

            <h3>Name the three ways to declare a variable?</h3>
            <p><code>let</code>, <code>const</code>, and <code>var</code></p>

            <h3>Which of the three variable declarations should you avoid and why?</h3>
            <p><code>var</code> is an outdated way to declare a variable, as it is globally scoped. This can cause
                issues especially when using multiple JavaScript files.</p>

            <h3>What rules should you follow when naming variables?</h3>
            <p>The hard rules are to not start with a number, and the only special characters allowed are <code>$</code>
                and <code>_</code>. You cannot use <strong>reserved</strong> words such as class, let, return, or
                function.<br>
                It is also best practice to use camelCase, give variables obvious, descriptive (human-readable) names
                (avoid things like
                <code>let abc = "Joe"</code> ) and keep them
                consistent throughout your code.<br>
            </p>

            <h3>What should you look out for when using the + operator with numbers and strings?</h3>
            <p>The <code>+</code> operator performs both addition and concatenation (joining). When using two numbers, +
                will add them together. When using two strings, + will concatenate them. When using a number and a
                string, + will concatenate them unless the string is first converted to a number.</p>

            <h3>How does the % operator work?</h3>
            <p>The <code>%</code> or 'modulo' operator is used to calculate the number left over from a division. E.g.
                <code>
                2
                    % 2
            </code> will equal 0 as there is nothing left over.
            </p>

            <h3>Explain the difference between == and ===.</h3>
            <p><code>===</code> is the strict comparison operator, meaning the operands being compared must be of the
                same type. Using <code>==</code> also compares but performs type coercion. <br>
                E.g. <code>2 == "2"</code> will return <code>true</code>, but <code>2 === "2"</code> will return
                <code>false</code> because the values are not the same type.
            </p>

            <h3>When would you receive a NaN result?</h3>
            <p>If you were to try to perform a mathematical equation using variables that are not numbers, e.g.
                <code>"Two" * 5</code> will result in <code>NaN</code>.
            </p>

            <h3>How do you increment and decrement a number?</h3>
            <p>Using the increment counter ++ or decrement counter --. You can also increment a variable immediately
                with +=.
            <pre>
            <code>let apples = 2;
                    apples++ // 2 + 1 = 3</code>
                    <code>
                    apples += 2 // 3 + 2 = 5
            </code></pre>
            </p>

            <h3>Explain the difference between prefixing and post-fixing increment/decrement operators.</h3>
            <p><span class="temp">One performs the count in a different order but I can't remember which.</span></p>

            <h3>What is operator precedence and how is it handled in JS?</h3>
            <p><span class="temp">I can't remember!</span></p>

            <h3>How do you access developer tools and the console?</h3>
            <p>Depending on your browser you can use a keyboard shortcut or through the menu: for Chrome this would be
                <code>cmd + option + i</code> or <code>menu > more tools > developer tools</code>.
            </p>

            <h3>How do you log information to the console?</h3>
            <p>Using the helpfully descriptive <code>console.log("Print this!")</code></p>

            <h3>What does unary plus operator do to string representations of integers?</h3>
            <p><span class="temp">It will concatenate them? Or convert them to numbers?</span></p>

            <h2>More JavaScript Basics</h2>

            <h3>What are the eight data types in JavaScript?</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>number</strong> e.g. let x = 123; This can be an integer or floating point (decimal) number.<br>

                <strong>string</strong> any text, including single characters e.g <code>let x = "hello";</code><br>

                <strong>boolean</strong> e.g. <code>let x = true;</code> or <code>let x = false;</code><br>

                <strong>bigInt</strong> - for numbers too big for the number type.<br>

                e.g <code>let x = 1233567890123356789012335678901233567890n</code> - where n creates a bigInt.<br>

                <strong>undefined</strong> - where a variable has been created, but not assigned a value e.g.
                <code>let x;</code>
                <br>

                <strong>null</strong> - where the value of the variable is not known or equal to nothing.<br>

                <strong>object</strong> - the only data type that is not primitive. It contains properties, made up of
                key/value pairs.<br>
            <pre>
            <code>
                let myObject = {
                    name: "mchlol",
                    age: 32,
                    skillLevel: beginner
                    }</code>
            </pre>

            Functions also belong to the object data type.<br>

            <strong>symbol</strong> a special property included in objects. <a
                href="https://javascript.info/symbol">Read
                more info about symbols here.</a>
            </p>
            <br>

            <h3>Which data type is NOT primitive?</h3>
            <p>Object, it can contain multiple types of data in properties, where other data types can only contain one
                type
                of data.</p>

            <h3>What is the relationship between null and undefined?</h3>
            <p>Null and undefined both technically mean "nothing" but only undefined can refer to an existing variable
                that
                exists but hasn't been assigned a value.</p>

            <h3>What is the difference between single, double, and backtick quotes for strings?</h3>
            <p>A string can use single quotes ' or double quotes " but cannot be used at the same time. Escape a quote
                by
                using the backslash \. Backticks ` can create strings with embedded variables. </p>
            <br>

            <h3>What is the term for embedding variables/expressions in a string?</h3>
            <p>Concatenate, or join.</p>
            <br>

            <h3>Which type of quote lets you embed variables/expressions in a string?</h3>
            <p>Backtick `</p>
            <br>

            <h3>How do you embed variables/expressions in a string?</h3>
            <p>By using backticks.<br>
            <pre>
    <code>let myName = "mchlol"
    let x = `Hello, my name is ${myName}, nice to meet you.`
    </code>
    <strong>x = "Hello, my name is mchlol, nice to  meet you."</strong>
    </pre>
            </p>
            <br>

            <h3>How do you escape characters in a string?</h3>
            <p>By using a backslash \ before the character.<br>
            <p>
            <pre>
        <code>let x = "I\'m making an example";
        </code>
        <strong>x = "I'm making an example"</strong>
        </pre>
            </p>
            <br>

            <h3>What are methods?</h3>
            <p>Methods are special operators in Javascript that can be used to perfom tasks such as convert a number to
                string, convert a string to upper or lowercase, or return the type of a variable.
            <pre>
            <code>let x = 123;
                let y = x.toString();
                console.log(y);
            </code>
            <strong>x = "123";</strong>
        </pre>
            </p>
            <br>

            <h3>What is the difference between slice/substring/substr?</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>.slice()</strong> can be used to extract part of a string, it takes two parameters - the first
                is
                the index to start at, and the second is the index to end at. The start is included in the extraction,
                but
                the end is not. Using a negative will count from the END of the string.<br>
                <strong>.substring()</strong> similar to .slice() but cannot take negatives.<br>
                <strong>.substr()</strong> can be used for the same thing as .string() but while the first parameter is
                still the index to start at, the second parameter is how many indexes after the starting index to end
                at.<br>
            </p>

            <h3>What are the three logical operators and what do they stand for?</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>&&</strong> - AND: Returns true only if the result of all cases is true<br>
                <strong>||</strong> - OR: Returns true as long as at least one case results in true<br>
                <strong>!</strong> - NOT: Returns true if result is false.<br>
            </p>

            <h3>What are the comparison operators?</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>==</strong> - equality, able to perform type conversion<br>
                <strong>===</strong> - strict equality, must be the same type<br>
                <strong>
                    < and>
                </strong> - less than or greater than</br>
                <strong>
                    <= and>=
                </strong> - less than or equal to, and greater than or equal to<br>
            </p>

            <h3>What are truthy and falsy values?</h3>
            <p>A truthy value is any value that can be equal to 1, or true, a falsy value is equal to 0, or false.<br>
            </p>

            <h3>What are the falsy values in JavaScript?</h3>
            <p>0</p>
            <br>

            <h3>What are conditionals?</h3>
            <p>Conditionals are performed to make decisions based on the boolean outcome of a conditional test. E.g. if
                true
                run this code, if false run this code.<br>
            </p>

            <h3>What is the syntax for an if/else conditional?</h3>
            <pre>
        <code>
            if (condition === true) {
                return true;
                } else {
                return false;
                }
            }
        </code>
    </pre>
            <br>

            <h3>What is the syntax for a switch statement?</h3>
            <pre>
        <code>
            let x = true;
            let result;
            switch(x) {
                case true:
                result = "yes";
                break;
                case false:
                result = "no";
                default:
                result = "not sure"
            }
        </code>
    </pre>
            <br>

            <h3>What is the syntax for a ternary operator?</h3>
            <pre>
        <code>
            (condition) ? code to run if true : code to run if false;
        </code>
    </pre>
            <br>

            <h3>What is nesting?</h3>
            <p>If you want to test another condition after one has been met, you can nest another condition within it.
                e.g.<br>
            <pre>
            <code>
                if (condition === true) {
                    if (anotherCondition === true) {
                        return true;
                    }
                } else {
                    return false;
                }
            </code>
        </pre>
