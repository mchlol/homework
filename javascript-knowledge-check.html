            <h2>Fundamentals Part 1</h2>

            <h3>Name the three ways to declare a variable?</h3>
            <p><code>let</code>, <code>const</code>, and <code>var</code></p>

            <h3>Which of the three variable declarations should you avoid and why?</h3>
            <p><code>var</code> is an outdated way to declare a variable, as it is globally scoped. This can cause
                issues especially when using multiple JavaScript files.</p>

            <h3>What rules should you follow when naming variables?</h3>
            <p>The hard rules are to not start with a number, and the only special characters allowed are <code>$</code>
                and <code>_</code>. You cannot use <strong>reserved</strong> words such as class, let, return, or
                function.<br>
                It is also best practice to use camelCase, give variables obvious, descriptive (human-readable) names
                (avoid things like
                <code>let abc = "Joe"</code> ) and keep them
                consistent throughout your code.<br>
            </p>

            <h3>What should you look out for when using the + operator with numbers and strings?</h3>
            <p>The <code>+</code> operator performs both addition and concatenation (joining). When using two numbers, +
                will add them together. When using two strings, + will concatenate them. When using a number and a
                string, + will concatenate them <em>unless</em> the string is first converted to a number.</p>

            <h3>How does the % operator work?</h3>
            <p>The <code>%</code> or 'modulo' operator is used to calculate the number left over from a division. E.g.
                <code>
                2
                    % 2
            </code> will equal 0 as there is nothing left over.
            </p>

            <h3>Explain the difference between == and ===.</h3>
            <p><code>===</code> is the strict comparison operator, meaning the operands being compared must be of the
                same type. Using <code>==</code> also compares, but performs type coercion, so should be mostly avoided
                as it can produce bugs. <br>
                E.g. <code>2 == "2"</code> will return <code>true</code>, but <code>2 === "2"</code> will return
                <code>false</code> because the values are not the same type - 2 is a number and "2" is a string.
            </p>

            <h3>When would you receive a NaN result?</h3>
            <p>If you were to try to perform a mathematical equation using variables that are not numbers, e.g.
                <code>"Two" * 5</code> will result in <code>NaN</code> because "Two" is a string, not a number.
            </p>

            <h3>How do you increment and decrement a number?</h3>
            <p>Using the increment counter ++ or decrement counter --. You can also increment a variable immediately
                with +=.
            <pre>
            <code>let apples = 2;
                    apples++ // 2 + 1 = 3</code>
                    <code>
                    apples += 2 // 3 + 2 = 5
            </code></pre>
            </p>

            <h3>Explain the difference between prefixing and post-fixing increment/decrement operators.</h3>
            <p>
                Postfixing <code>counter++</code> and prefixing <code>++counter</code> both do the same thing. If we
                intend immediately use the increased or decreased value, we would use the prefix form
                <code>++counter</code>. If we would like to increase the value but start off using the original value,
                we use the postfix form <code>counter++</code>.
            </p>

            <h3>What is operator precedence and how is it handled in JS?</h3>
            <p>Operator precedence determines the order in which operators in an expression will execute. There is a <a
                    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence"
                    target="_blank">precedence table</a> that outlines the priority value of all of the operators, the
                one with the highest number is executed first.
                E.g. <code>1 + 2 * 2</code> will first perform addition because the + operator has higher precedence
                than *. </p>

            <h3>How do you access developer tools and the console?</h3>
            <p>Depending on your browser you can use a keyboard shortcut or through the menu: for Chrome this would be
                <code>cmd + option + i</code> or <code>menu > more tools > developer tools</code>.
            </p>

            <h3>How do you log information to the console?</h3>
            <p>Using the helpfully descriptive <code>console.log("Print this!")</code></p>

            <h3>What does unary plus operator do to string representations of integers?</h3>
            <p>If you have values as strings, <code>"one"</code> and <code>"two"</code>, they will be treated as
                strings,
                not numbers, so the unary
                plus
                operator (+) will concatenate (join) them together as a string, like so: <code>"onetwo"</code><br>
                If the values are <code>"1"</code> and <code>"2"</code> these are still strings, not numbers, so you
                will still get <code>"12"</code> (a string), even if
                one is actually of type number (like <code>"1"</code>
                and <code>2</code>). You can only end up with <code>3</code> if both values are of type
                <code>number</code>, ie. <code>1</code> and
                <code>2</code>.

            <h2>Fundamentals Part 2</h2>

            <h3>What are the eight data types in JavaScript?</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>number</strong> e.g. let x = 123; This can be an integer or floating point (decimal) number.<br>

                <strong>string</strong> any text, including single characters e.g <code>let x = "hello";</code><br>

                <strong>boolean</strong> e.g. <code>let x = true;</code> or <code>let x = false;</code><br>

                <strong>bigInt</strong> - for numbers too big for the number type.<br>

                e.g <code>let x = 1233567890123356789012335678901233567890n</code> - where n creates a bigInt.<br>

                <strong>undefined</strong> - where a variable has been created, but not assigned a value e.g.
                <code>let x;</code>
                <br>

                <strong>null</strong> - where the value of the variable is not known or equal to nothing.<br>

                <strong>object</strong> - the only data type that is not primitive. It contains properties, made up of
                key/value pairs.<br>
            <pre>
            <code>
                let myObject = {
                    name: "mchlol",
                    age: 32,
                    skillLevel: beginner
                    }</code>
            </pre>

            Functions and arrays also belong to the object data type.<br>

            <strong>symbol</strong> a special property included in objects. <a
                href="https://javascript.info/symbol">Read
                more info about symbols here.</a>
            </p>
            <br>

            <h3>Which data type is NOT primitive?</h3>
            <p>Objects are not primitive - they can contain multiple types of data in properties, where other data types
                can only contain one
                type
                of data.<br>
                Functions and arrays are objects.</p>

            <h3>What is the relationship between null and undefined?</h3>
            <p>Null and undefined both technically mean "nothing" but only undefined can refer to an existing variable
                that
                exists but hasn't been assigned a value.</p>

            <h3>What is the difference between single, double, and backtick quotes for strings?</h3>
            <p>A string can use single quotes ' or double quotes " but cannot be used at the same time. Escape a quote
                by
                using the backslash \. Backticks ` can create strings with embedded variables.</p>
            <br>

            <h3>What is the term for embedding variables/expressions in a string?</h3>
            <p>Template literal</p>
            <br>

            <h3>Which type of quote lets you embed variables/expressions in a string?</h3>
            <p>Backtick `</p>
            <br>

            <h3>How do you embed variables/expressions in a string?</h3>
            <p>By using backticks.<br>
            <pre>
    <code>let myName = "Bob"
    let x = `Hello, my name is ${myName}, nice to meet you.`
    </code>
    <strong>x = "Hello, my name is Bob, nice to  meet you."</strong>
    </pre>
            </p>
            <br>

            <h3>How do you escape characters in a string?</h3>
            <p>By using a backslash \ before the character.<br>
            <p>
            <pre>
        <code>let x = "I\'m making an example";
        </code>
        <strong>x = "I'm making an example"</strong>
        </pre>
            </p>
            <br>

            <h3>What are methods?</h3>
            <p>Methods are built in functions in Javascript that can be used to perfom common tasks, such as convert a
                number to
                string, convert a string to upper or lowercase, or return the type of a variable.
            <pre>
            <code>let x = 123;
                let y = x.toString();
                console.log(y);
            </code>
            <strong>x = "123";</strong>
        </pre>
            </p>
            <br>

            <h3>What is the difference between slice/substring/substr?</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>.slice()</strong> can be used to extract part of a string, it takes two parameters - the first
                is
                the index to start at, and the second is the index to end at. The start is included in the extraction,
                but
                the end is not. Using a negative integer for the first argument will count from the END of the
                string.<br>
                <strong>.substring()</strong> similar to .slice() but cannot take negatives.<br>
                <strong>.substr()</strong> can be used for the same thing as .string() but while the first parameter is
                still the index to start at, the second parameter is how many indexes after the starting index to end
                at.<br>
            </p>

            <h3>What are the three logical operators and what do they stand for?</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>&&</strong> - AND: Returns true only if the result of all cases is true<br>
                <strong>||</strong> - OR: Returns true as long as at least one case results in true<br>
                <strong>!</strong> - NOT: Returns true if result is false.<br>
            </p>

            <h3>What are the comparison operators?</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>==</strong> - equality, able to perform type conversion<br>
                <strong>===</strong> - strict equality, must be the same type<br>
                <strong>
                    &lt; and &gt;
                </strong> - less than or greater than</br>
                <strong>
                    &lt;= and &gt;=
                </strong> - less than or equal to, and greater than or equal to<br>
            </p>

            <h3>What are truthy and falsy values?</h3>
            <p>A truthy value is any value that can be equal to 1, or true, a falsy value is equal to 0, or false.<br>
                <span class="temp">Is -1 also falsy?</span>
            </p>

            <h3>What are the falsy values in JavaScript?</h3>
            <p>False, 0, -0, an empty string, null, undefined, and NaN.<br>
                NaN is not equivalent to anything, including another NaN.</p>
            <br>

            <h3>What are conditionals?</h3>
            <p>Conditionals are performed to make decisions based on the boolean outcome of a conditional test. E.g. if
                true
                run this code, if false run this code.<br>
                It is usually possible to use only one value to determine true of false, e.g. <code>if (a)</code> will
                return true if the variable <code>a</code> has a truthy value.
            </p>

            <h3>What is the syntax for an if/else conditional?</h3>
            <pre>
        <code>
            if (condition === true) {
                return true;
                } else {
                return false;
                }
            }
        </code>
    </pre>
            <br>

            <h3>What is the syntax for a switch statement?</h3>
            <pre>
        <code>
            let x = true;
            let result;
            switch(x) {
                case true:
                result = "yes";
                break;
                case false:
                result = "no";
                default:
                result = "not sure"
            }
        </code>
    </pre>
            <br>

            <h3>What is the syntax for a ternary operator?</h3>
            <pre>
        <code>
            (condition) ? code to run if true : code to run if false;
        </code>
    </pre>
            <br>

            <h3>What is nesting?</h3>
            <p>If you want to test another condition after one has been met, you can nest another condition within it.
                e.g.<br>
            <pre>
            <code>
                if (condition === true) {
                    if (anotherCondition === true) {
                        return true;
                    }
                } else {
                    return false;
                }
            </code>
        </pre>

            <h2>JavaScript Developer Tools</h2>

            <h3>How do you open developer tools?</h3>
            <p>I'm using Chrome, so <code>option + command + i</code></p>

            <h3>How do you change screen size of a website using developer tools?</h3>
            <p>Using device mode, you can either resize the window yourself or choose between preset sizes of popular
                devices (such as the various releases of iPhone).</p>

            <h3>What is a breakpoint?</h3>
            <p>A breakpoint is a point in your code which you can pause your script at to see what its doing step by
                step.</p>

            <h3>How do you set a breakpoint?</h3>
            <p>You either type in a <code>debugger;</code> directly into your code, click on the line in the dev tools
                sources tab, or set a breakpoint on an event listener in the dev tools. You can also right click on an
                element in the elements tab and set a breakpoint as an event listener there too.</p>

            <h2>Fundamentals Part 3</h2>

            <h3>What are functions useful for?</h3>
            <p>Functions are actions performed by your code that can be used over and over again.</p>

            <h3>How do you invoke a function?</h3>
            <p>Invoke a function by calling it with functionName(). The parentheses perform the action of actually
                calling the function - the function will not run without them.
            </p>

            <h3>What are anonymous functions?</h3>
            <p>Anonymous functions are functions that are used as part of an expression, their return value is used
                immediately and the function itself is not used again.</p>

            <h3>What is function scope?</h3>
            <p>Function scope refers to the variables with a functions code block <em>only</em> being accessible within
                the function itself. If a variable is defined within a function, it cannot be accessed anywhere else.
            </p>

            <h3>What are return values?</h3>
            <p>Return values are the products of a function when it is called. For example if you want to run a function
                that adds two numbers together, the return value will be the result of the addition.</p>

            <h3>What are arrow functions?</h3>
            <p>An arrow function is a shorter more concise way of writing a function expression.</p>
