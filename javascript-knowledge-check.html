        <h3>What are the eight data types in JavaScript?</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>number</strong> e.g. let x = 123; This can be an integer or floating point (decimal) number.<br>

            <strong>string</strong> any text, including single characters e.g <code>let x = "hello";</code><br>

            <strong>boolean</strong> e.g. <code>let x = true;</code> or <code>let x = false;</code><br>

            <strong>bigInt</strong> - for numbers too big for the number type.<br>

            e.g <code>let x = 1233567890123356789012335678901233567890n</code> - where n creates a bigInt.<br>

            <strong>undefined</strong> - where a variable has been created, but not assigned a value e.g.
            <code>let x;</code>
            <br>

            <strong>null</strong> - where the value of the variable is not known or equal to nothing.<br>

            <strong>object</strong> - the only data type that is not primitive. It contains properties, made up of
            key/value pairs.<br>
        <pre>
            <code>
                let myObject = {
                    name: "mchlol",
                    age: 32,
                    skillLevel: beginner
                    }</code>
            </pre>

        Functions also belong to the object data type.<br>

        <strong>symbol</strong> a special property included in objects. <a href="https://javascript.info/symbol">Read
            more info about symbols here.</a>
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>Which data type is NOT primitive?</h3>
        <p>Object, it can contain multiple types of data in properties, where other data types can only contain one type
            of data.</p>

        <h3>What is the relationship between null and undefined?</h3>
        <p>Null and undefined both technically mean "nothing" but only undefined can refer to an existing variable that
            exists but hasn't been assigned a value.</p>

        <h3>What is the difference between single, double, and backtick quotes for strings?</h3>
        <p>A string can use single quotes ' or double quotes " but cannot be used at the same time. Escape a quote by
            using the backslash \. Backticks ` can create strings with embedded variables. </p>
        <br>

        <h3>What is the term for embedding variables/expressions in a string?</h3>
        <p>Concatenate, or join.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>Which type of quote lets you embed variables/expressions in a string?</h3>
        <p>Backtick `</p>
        <br>

        <h3>How do you embed variables/expressions in a string?</h3>
        <p>By using backticks.<br>
        <pre>
    <code>let myName = "mchlol"
    let x = `Hello, my name is ${myName}, nice to meet you.`
    </code>
    <strong>x = "Hello, my name is mchlol, nice to  meet you."</strong>
    </pre>
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>How do you escape characters in a string?</h3>
        <p>By using a backslash \ before the character.<br>
        <p>
        <pre>
        <code>let x = "I\'m making an example";
        </code>
        <strong>x = "I'm making an example"</strong>
        </pre>
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>What are methods?</h3>
        <p>Methods are special operators in Javascript that can be used to perfom tasks such as convert a number to
            string, convert a string to upper or lowercase, or return the type of a variable.
        <pre>
            <code>let x = 123;
                let y = x.toString();
                console.log(y);
            </code>
            <strong>x = "123";</strong>
        </pre>
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>What is the difference between slice/substring/substr?</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>.slice()</strong> can be used to extract part of a string, it takes two parameters - the first is
            the index to start at, and the second is the index to end at. The start is included in the extraction, but
            the end is not. Using a negative will count from the END of the string.<br>
            <strong>.substring()</strong> similar to .slice() but cannot take negatives.<br>
            <strong>.substr()</strong> can be used for the same thing as .string() but while the first parameter is
            still the index to start at, the second parameter is how many indexes after the starting index to end
            at.<br>
        </p>

        <h3>What are the three logical operators and what do they stand for?</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>&&</strong> - AND: Returns true only if the result of all cases is true<br>
            <strong>||</strong> - OR: Returns true as long as at least one case results in true<br>
            <strong>!</strong> - NOT: Returns true if result is false.<br>
        </p>

        <h3>What are the comparison operators?</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>==</strong> - equality, able to perform type conversion<br>
            <strong>===</strong> - strict equality, must be the same type<br>
            <strong>
                < and>
            </strong> - less than or greater than</br>
            <strong>
                <= and>=
            </strong> - less than or equal to, and greater than or equal to<br>
        </p>

        <h3>What are truthy and falsy values?</h3>
        <p>A truthy value is any value that can be equal to 1, or true, a falsy value is equal to 0, or false.<br>
        </p>

        <h3>What are the falsy values in JavaScript?</h3>
        <p>0</p>
        <br>

        <h3>What are conditionals?</h3>
        <p>Conditionals are performed to make decisions based on the boolean outcome of a conditional test. E.g. if true
            run this code, if false run this code.<br>
        </p>

        <h3>What is the syntax for an if/else conditional?</h3>
        <pre>
        <code>
            if (condition === true) {
                return true;
                } else {
                return false;
                }
            }
        </code>
    </pre>
        <br>

        <h3>What is the syntax for a switch statement?</h3>
        <pre>
        <code>
            let x = true;
            let result;
            switch(x) {
                case true:
                result = "yes";
                break;
                case false:
                result = "no";
                default:
                result = "not sure"
            }
        </code>
    </pre>
        <br>

        <h3>What is the syntax for a ternary operator?</h3>
        <pre>
        <code>
            (condition) ? code to run if true : code to run if false;
        </code>
    </pre>
        <br>

        <h3>What is nesting?</h3>
        <p>If you want to test another condition after one has been met, you can nest another condition within it.
            e.g.<br>
        <pre>
            <code>
                if (condition === true) {
                    if (anotherCondition === true) {
                        return true;
                    }
                } else {
                    return false;
                }
            </code>
        </pre>
