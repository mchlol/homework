        <h3>What are the 3 values defined in the shorthand <code>flex</code> property? (e.g.
            <code>flex: 1 1 auto</code>)?
        </h3>
        <p>Flex grow, flex shrink, and flex basis (min, max, and ideal size). </p>
        <p></p><code>flex: initial</code> is the same as
        setting <code>flex: 0 1 auto</code>.
        </p>

        <h3>What is flex grow?</h3>
        <p>Flex grow determines if the flex item can grow to fill the available space. If an item has a larger flex grow
            property than the other items, it will be bigger.</p>

        <h3>What is flex shrink?</h3>
        <p>Flex shrink determines if the flex item can shrink when the container shrinks, and how much. If the flex
            shrink property is larger on one item than the others, it will shrink more.</p>

        <h3>What is flex basis?</h3>
        <p>Flex basis sets the initial or ideal size of a flex item. If set to auto, it will look at the set height or
            width, or the size of the content. If set to 100%, it will take up the entire space of the parent container,
            either height or width depending on the main axis (row or column).
        </p>

        <h3>How do you make flex items arrange themselves vertically instead of horizontally?</h3>
        <p>You can arrange flex items vertically instead of horizontally by changing the rule on the flex container to
            <code>flex-direction: column</code>.
        </p>

        <h3>In a column flex-container, what does flex-basis refer to?</h3>
        <p>Flex basis will refer to the height of the flex item.</p>

        <h3>In a row flex-container, what does flex-basis refer to?</h3>
        <p>Flex basis will refer to the width of the flex item.</p>
        <h3>Why do the previous two questions have different answers?</h3>
        <p>When flex direction is set to column, the main axis is vertical and the cross axis is horizontal. When
            flex-direction
            set to row, the main axis is horizontal and the cross axis is vertical.</p>

        <h3>What is the difference between <code>justify-content</code> and <code>align-items?</code></h3>
        <p>Justify-content will organise the items along the main axis, and align-items organises them along the cross
            axis.</p>

        <h3>How do you use flexbox to completely center a div inside a flex container?</h3>
        <p>Use justify-content to center along the main axis and align-items to center along the cross axis.</p>

        <h3>Whatâ€™s the difference between justify-content: space-between and justify-content: space-around?</h3>
        <p>Space-between will organise items with even space between them, and space-around will organise items with
            even space between them AND on either side.</p>
