        <h3>What is the DOM?</h3>
        <p>The DOM, or Document Object Model, is a tree-like representation of the contents of an html page. When the
            html code is parsed by the brower it is converted to the DOM. For example, the body is the parent of all the
            elements that display on the page, which are in turn children of the body. Any element that contains another
            element is it's parent. The elements are called "nodes".</p>

        <h3>How do you target the nodes you want to work with?</h3>
        <p>You can target a specific node using CSS selectors. To target an element using its ID, you can use
            <code>document.querySelector("#container")</code> or you can target all the elements that share a class by
            using <code>document.querySelector(".wrapper")</code>. You can also select a group of nodes by selecting all
            divs or paragraphs with <code>document.querySelectorAll("div")</code>.<br>
            Another way to target nodes is by using relationship selectors, such as firstElementChild or
            lastElementChild.</p>

        <h3>How do you create an element in the DOM?</h3>
        <p>Create an element, such as a div, in the DOM with
            <code>const container = document.createElement("div")</code>.</p>

        <h3>How do you add an element to the DOM?</h3>
        <p>Add an element to the DOM by appending it to a div or container that you have assigned to a variable;
        <pre><code>
    const container = document.querySelector("#container");
    const newDiv = document.createElement("div");
    newDiv.textContent = "I'm a new div!";
    container.appendChild(newDiv);
        </code></pre>
        <div id="div-example">

        </div>
        </p>

        <h3>How do you remove an element from the DOM?</h3>
        <p>To remove an element you can use <code>container.removeChild(newDiv)</code>.</p>

        <h3>How can you alter an element in the DOM?</h3>
        <p>You can add styles to your element directly through JavaScript, or by adding a class to it and then styling
            it with CSS.<br>
            <code></code>
        </p>

        <h3>When adding text to a DOM element, should you use textContent or innerHTML? Why?</h3>
        <p>You should use textContent, because allowing the innerHTML of an element to be altered leaves it vulnerable
            to malicious script injecting.</p>

        <h3>Where should you include your Javascript tag in your HTML file when working with DOM nodes?</h3>
        <p>Your Javascript file should go at the end of your body, so that it runs after all of the code in your HTML
            has been parsed by the browser. Otherwise it may not be able to access elements that have not been created
            yet.<br>
            You can link an external JavaScript file, or put a script tag at the end of your body.<br>
            You can also put it in your head tag, but use <code>defer</code> to run it last.<br>
            <code>&#x3C;script src=&#x22;script.js&#x22; defer&#x3E;&#x3C;/script&#x3E;</code><br>
        </p>

        <h3>How do “events” and “listeners” work?</h3>
        <p>An event is a mouse click or hover, key press, or other form of interaction with an HTML page. A listener can
            'listen' for an 'event' and run some code when the 'event' happens.</p>

        <h3>What are three ways to use events in your code?</h3>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Attach an event listener directly in the html tag of your element. Such as;
                <code>&#x3C;button onclick=&#x22;alert(&#x27;hello&#x27;)&#x22;&#x3E;Say hello&#x3C;/button&#x3E;</code>
                = <button onclick="alert('hello')">Say hello</button>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>You can also use the onclick property in an external javascript file.<br>
                If your html is set up like so:<br>
                <code>&#x3C;button id="btn2">Say hello&#x3C;/button&#x3E;</code>
                <br>
                Your JavaScript file would access it like this: <br>
                <pre><code>const btn2 = document.querySelector("#btn2");
btn2.onclick = () => alert("hello...again");</code></pre>
                <button id="btn2">Say hello</button>
                <br>
                In either of the above two points, your button can only have one onclick property.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>The third way is to use an event listener in your external JavaScript file, rather than just onclick.
                This way we can add any other kinds of event listeners to the button.
                <pre><code>btn2.addEventListener('click', () => { 
                    alert("hello...again");
                });
</code></pre>
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Why are event listeners the preferred way to handle events?</h3>
        <p>we can attach an event listener for click, one for right click, one for hover, and so on.</p>

        <h3>What are the benefits of using named functions in your listeners?</h3>
        <p>Using a named function means you can read the code and understand what it does much easier, and you can reuse
            that function elsewhere.</p>

        <h3>How do you attach listeners to groups of nodes?</h3>
        <p>Attach a listener to a group of nodes, by using <code>document.querySelectorAll("button")</code> which would
            add the listener to all buttons in your html file. Iterate through the buttons (or other group of elements)
            with:</p>
        <pre><code>
    buttons.forEach(button) => {
        button.addEventListener('click', () => {
            alert("Hello");
        });
    });
            </code></pre>

        <h3>What is the difference between the return values of querySelector and querySelectorAll?</h3>
        <p>With querySelector you can select one element at a time, and it will only return that one element. With
            querySelectorAll, you can target all the elements of a specific type or class, and it will return them in a
            "nodelist".</p>

        <h3>What does a “nodelist” contain?</h3>
        <p>A nodelist contains all the elements of a type or class, accessed using querySelectorAll. A nodelist is very
            similar to an array, but can not use all of the </p>

        <h3>Explain the difference between “capture” and “bubbling”.</h3>
        <p>'Bubbling' is when events are triggered upwards through the nodes of an element. When an event handler is
            triggered on an element, it will first happen on the element, then any handlers on it's parent with be
            triggered, and so on for any ancestors above it.<br>
            'Capturing' is when the events happen in the opposite order, or downwards. If an onclick property is
            attached to a paragraph, which is nested within a div, which in turn is a child of your body tag, any event
            listener on the body will happen first, then on the div, then finally on the paragraph.<br>
            This series of events is known as 'propogation' and is very useful for things like forms. However, it is
            possilbe to stop it with <code>event.stopPropogation()</code>.
