            <h2>Elements and Tags</h2>

            <h3>What is an HTML tag?</h3>
            <p>Tags tell the browser what kind of content the element will contain, so it knows how to interpret it.</p>

            <h3>What are the three parts of an HTML element?</h3>
            <p>An opening tag, content, and a closing tag.</p>

            <h2>HTML boilerplate</h2>

            <h3>What is the purpose of the doctype declaration?</h3>
            <p>
                The doctype declaration tells the browser which version of HTML to use.
            </p>

            <h3>What is the HTML element?</h3>
            <p>The HTML element is the root of the webpage, and contains all of the elements.</p>

            <h3>What is the purpose of the head element?</h3>
            <p>
                The head element contains all of the meta- information about the webpage such as the title, character
                encoding, and links to external stylesheets. Nothing that needs to be visible is put in the head, only
                in
                the body.
            </p>

            <h3>What is the purpose of the body element?</h3>
            <p>The body element contains the actual content of the webpage to be displayed, such as text and images.</p>

            <h2>Working with Text</h2>

            <h3>How do you create a paragraph in HTML?</h3>
            <p><code>&lt;p&gt;Paragraph text content goes here!&lt;/p&gt;</code></p>

            <h3>How do you create a heading in HTML?</h3>
            <p>For a top level heading, <code>&lt;h1&gt;Heading&lt;/h1&gt;</code></p>

            <h3>How many different levels of headings are there and what is the difference between them?</h3>
            <p>
                There are six levels of headings, and these are used the same way as in essays or articles to indicate
                the
                hierarchy of the content.
            </p>

            <h3>What element should you use to make text bold and important?</h3>
            <p><code>strong</code></p>

            <h3>What element should you use to make text italicized to add emphasis to it?</h3>
            <p><code>em</code> (for emphasis)</p>

            <h3>What relationship does an element have with any nested elements within it?</h3>
            <p>An element that has nested elements within it is the parent of those elements (which become children).
            </p>

            <h3>What relationship do two elements have if they are at the same level of nesting?</h3>
            <p>Two elements at the same level of nesting are siblings.</p>

            <h3>How do you create HTML comments?</h3>
            <p><code>&lt;!-- comment text would go here --&gt;</code></p>

            <h2>Lists</h2>

            <h3>What HTML tag is used to create an unordered list? </h3>
            <p><code>ul</code> will create a list of bullet points.</p>

            <h3>What HTML tag is used to create an ordered list? </h3>
            <p><code>ol</code> will create a list with consecutive numbering.</p>

            <h3>What HTML tag is used to create list items within both unordered and ordered lists? </h3>
            <p><code>li</code> will create a list item, and is the same within an unordered or an ordered list. </p>
            <pre>
<code>
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;This is a list item&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;This is another list item&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

        <section id="links">
            <h2>Links and Images</h2>

            <h3>What element is used to create a link?</h3>
            <p>&lt;a&gt;</p>

            <h3>What is an attribute?</h3>
            <p>
                An attribute is used to tell the browser more information about the type of content your tag will
                include.
            </p>

            <h3>What attribute tells links where to go to?</h3>
            <p><code>href</code>, e.g. <code>&lt;a href=“http://www.google.com”&gt;</code></p>

            <h3>What is the difference between an absolute and relative link?</h3>
            <p>
                An absolute link includes the entire path of a link, whereas a relative link contains only part of
                the path. The former is usually used to link to an entirely different website. The latter is used
                when linking to files within the same directory.
            </p>

            <h3>Which element is used to display an image?</h3>
            <p><code>&lt;img&gt;</code></p>

            <h3>What two attributes do images always need to have?</h3>
            <p>
                An image tag must always include a <code>src</code> attribute, to point the browser to the correct file.
                It also
                must always include an <code>alt</code> attribute, to provide further info about the image in case the
                image
                cannot be loaded or the user is using a screenreader.
            </p>

            <h3>How do you access a parent directory in a filepath?</h3>
            <p>
                Using two dots will direct the file path to the folder directly above the current one, e.g.
                <code>../filename.jpg</code>
            </p>

            <h3>What are the four main image formats that you can use for images on the web?</h3>
            <p>Jpg (or jpeg), png, gif, and svg. There is also webp but it's not so widely used yet.</p>
