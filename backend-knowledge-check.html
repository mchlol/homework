        <h3>What is back-end development?</h3>
        <p>Back-end development is where all the data is stored for a website or web application to make it work. The
            front-end is where a user can interact with a website or app - but when a
            client requests information, the back-end provides it. The back-end can be written in any programming
            language, but languages may
            need to be installed on the server in order for it to be able to understand it.</p>

        <h3>How many parts does the backend consist of? & Name each part of the backend.</h3>
        <p>The backend consists of the server, the application, and the database.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The server is the computer that receives the requests.</li>
            <li>The application processes the requests - it listens for a request from the client, retrieves the
                relevant info from the database, and sends back a response to the client.</li>
            <li>The database contains and organises all the data.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Where does the backend store its data?</h3>
        <p>In a database, which is an interface that can be accessed by the application to process requests.</p>

        <h3>What is a framework?</h3>
        <p></p>

        <h3>What's the difference between a programming language and a framework?</h3>
        <p></p>

        <h3>What languages have frameworks?</h3>
        <p></p>

        <h3>What are the four general tasks that developers have to handle?</h3>
        <p>CRUD - create, read, update, and delete.</p>

        <h3>What problems do frameworks solve?</h3>
        <p>Frameworks contain code that is often repeated so that the developer doesn't need to write it all from
            scratch every time. It also helps structure and create clean, easily readable code.</p>

        <h3>Name some popular front-end and back-end frameworks.</h3>
        <p>Django and Flask for Python, Ruby on Rails for Ruby, Express and Meteor for JavaScript.</p>

        <h3>Describe the process of choosing a framework.</h3>
        <p>Choosing the correct framework for your application depends on;<br>
        <ul>
            <li>Ease of use - the language a framework is written in, and your familiarity with it</li>
            <li>Security</li>
            <li>Scalability</li>
            <li>Caching support</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>What is a "technology stack"?</h3>
        <p>In order to develop a web application, you need to use a server such as Apache or Nginx, a database such as
            MongoDB, a programming language (such as Python, Ruby, or PHP), a backend framework (such as Django for
            Python, or
            Laravel for PHP), and a front end framework such as React for JavaScript. You also need a host for your
            server. <br>E.g.
            Wordpress
            is a web
            application written in PHP.</p>
