            <h2>Objects and Object Constructors</h2>

            <h3>Write an object constructor and instantiate the object.</h3>
            <pre>
            <code>
                // object constructor:
            function Cat(name, sound) {
                this.name = name,
                this.sound = sound
            }
            
                // instantiate the object
            const fluffy = new Cat('Fluffy', 'miaow!');
            </code>
            </pre>

            <h3>Describe what a prototype is and how it can be used.</h3>
            <p>
                A prototype is a property that exists by default on any JavaScript function (all functions are objects).
                Add methods onto this
                prototype, and they can be used by any object created using the function as a constructor; such objects
                are also known as <strong>instances</strong>.</p>

            <h3>Explain prototypal inheritance.</h3>
            <p>When an object is created with a constructor, it will inherit any properties and methods from its parent
                object, which in turn inherits these from its parent and so on back to
                <code>Object.prototype</code>.<br>
                When a lookup is performed on an object, it will look
                first on that object, and if the property is not found, the search will continues on that objects
                prototype, and so on up
                the chain until the property is found.
            </p>

            <h3>What are the basic dos and don'ts of prototypical inheritance?</h3>
            <p><strong>Don't</strong> define a function directly on an object constructor - unless you want it to be
                available only on
                that object. Defining it on the prototype means only defining it once, and not creating multiples of
                the same function every time a new object is created.<br>
                <strong>Do</strong> use an objects prototype to define functions. This is so they can be used by all
                instances of that
                object,
                and the function only needs to be defined once. This will keep your files smaller and help you to write
                clean code.
            </p>

            <h3>Explain what Object.create does.</h3>
            <p><code>Object.create(obj)</code> creates an object, where <code>obj</code> is the object to inherit
                properties from.</p>

            <h3>Notes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Any object can only have ONE prototype and can only inherit from ONE object prototype at a
                    time.</li>
                <li>Arrow functions do not have a <code>this</code> keyword or a prototype property so cannot be used as
                    constructor functions.</li>
            </ul>
