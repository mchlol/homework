            <p>
                <strong>p.text</strong>: where <strong> p </strong> is the element to be created, <strong> . </strong>

            <h3>What syntax expands to an element with a child element inside of it?</h3>

            <h2>Form Basics</h2>

            <h3>Explain what the form element is for and what two attributes it should always include.</h3>
            <p>
                The form element is used to collect data from a user, such as leaving comments on a blog, filling out a
                survey, signing up to an email list, or taking payment on an e-commerce site.<br>
                The form must include an <code>action</code> attribute to determine where the data is sent, usually a
                url,
                and a
                <code>method</code> element to determine how the data is sent - usually GET to retrieve data from the
                server, or POST to send data to the server.
            </p>

            <h3>Explain what form controls are at a high level.</h3>
            <p>
                Form controls are elements in the form that the user interacts with to provide specific data - these can
                be
                input elements such as number, email, or telephone numbers, or selection inputs where some data is
                provided
                for the user to choose from, such as radio buttons, checkboxes, ranges, and even color-pickers or dates.
            </p>

            <h3>What is the name attribute for?</h3>
            <p>
                The name attribute provides the data with a reference, so when the data is sent to the server it can be
                identified with the relevant label.
            </p>

            <h3>What are the three most common form controls you can use for allowing users to select predefined
                options?
            </h3>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>checkbox</code>, which allow the user to select one or more from a range of items, displayed
                    as
                    boxes to be checked.</li>
                <li><code>radio</code>, which provides a short selection of items displayed as circles for the user to
                    choose only one of.</li>
                <li><code>select</code>, like <code>radio</code> the user can only select one item, but this is used for
                    a
                    longer
                    list of options displayed as a dropdown menu.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>What are the three types of buttons in html?</h3>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reset</strong> - clears all the data a user has entered into the form's inputs.</li>
                <li><strong>Submit</strong> - submits the form's data to the provided <code>action</code>.</li>
                <li><strong>Anonymous</strong> - a generic button that can do anything, usually DOM related using
                    JavaScript.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>What are the two most challenging aspects of styling forms?</h3>
            <p>
                One is that most input elements use native browser styling, and it can be difficult to remove these
                default
                styles and re-style them while remaining consistent across different browsers (and be accessible).<br>
                The other is that some elements cannot be styled with CSS at all, such as <code>color-picker</code> or
                <code>date-time-local</code> and the only way around this is to use
                JavaScript (however, many libraries are available for this).<br>
                Another tricky thing to remember is that padding and margin affect
                the inside of the input elements instead of the space around them. Putting the inputs inside
                <code>div</code> or <code>li</code> elements can get around this.

        <section id="validation">
            <h2>Form Validation</h2>

            <h3>What does the required validation do?</h3>
            <p>The <code>required</code> validation lets the user know the field must be filled in, or the form will not
                submit.</p>

            <h3>What validations can you use for checking text length?</h3>
            <p>
                <code>minlength</code> and <code>maxlength</code>
            </p>

            <h3>How can you validate the minimum and maximum of numeric inputs?</h3>
            <p>
                <code>min</code> and <code>max</code>
            </p>

            <h3>What can you use the pattern validation for?</h3>
            <p>Pattern validation via regex can be used to ensure the user enters the correct information, such as a
                valid
                credit card
                number, or creating a strong password.</p>

            <h3>What pseudo css selectors are available for styling valid and invalid inputs?</h3>
            <p>
                <code>:valid</code> and <code>:invalid</code>
            </p>

            <hr>

            <h2>SVG</h2>

            <h3>What is the xmlns attribute?</h3>
            <p>
                <code>xmlns</code> stands for <strong>xml (extensible markup language) name-space</strong>, which
                specifies
                how the elements markup should be interpreted.
            </p>

            <h3>What are some situations where you wouldn't want to use SVG?</h3>
            <p>SVG is a vector format so perfect for simple lines and shapes such as icons, charts, line drawings, and
                text.
                It is not suitable for images with a lot of data such as photos.</p>

            <h3>What are the benefits of “inlining” your SVGs? What are the drawbacks?</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Inlining</strong> SVG files means that the file can be accessed through the DOM with CSS and
                JavaScript, eg. to animate, or change colours. However, large SVG files can make your page load slowly,
                be
                harder to cache, and harder for a human to read your HTML.

        <section id="tables">
            <h2>Tables</h2>

            <h3>What is a table?</h3>
            <p>
                A table is used to structure data into an easily readable and referenceable format.
            </p>

            <h3>Why is it a bad idea to use HTML Tables for page layout?</h3>
            <p>
                Using HTML tables for page layout has been deprecated because it causes confusion for screenreaders.
            </p>

            <h3>What are caption elements useful for?</h3>
            <p>
                Caption elements give a brief summary of what the data in the table is for, and can be read by a
                screenreader to give the user the option of reading all the data in the table or not.
            </p>

            <h3>What is the scope attribute?</h3>
            <p>
                The scope attribute organises the data in the table so that a screenreader can easily read out what
                piece of
                data relates to which headers. Another way to do this is specifically label each cell of data with all
                the
                relevant headers, but this can be tedious to write and is prone to error.
            </p>

        <section id="browser">
            <h2>Browser Compatibility</h2>
            <h3>What is the most used browser currently?</h3>
            <p>Google Chrome</p>
            <h3>What was the original name of the first web browser?</h3>
            <p>WorldWideWeb, created by Tim Berners-Lee on a NeXT computer. The browser was later renamed to Nexus. It
                could not only display pages, but also create and edit them.</p>

            <h3>How are mobile browsers different on Apple mobile operating systems from Android?</h3>
            <p>Browers on Android devices can use their usual
                rendering engine such as Blink for Chrome or Gecko for Firefox. However, a;l browsers on Apple devices
                use
                the WebKit rendering engine.</p>
