            <h2>Flexbox</h2>

            <h3>What are the 3 values defined in the shorthand <code>flex</code> property? (e.g.
                <code>flex: 1 1 auto</code>)?
            </h3>
            <p>Flex grow, flex shrink, and flex basis (min, max, and ideal size). </p>
            <p></p><code>flex: initial</code> is the same as
            setting <code>flex: 0 1 auto</code>.
            </p>

            <h3>What is flex grow?</h3>
            <p>Flex grow determines if the flex item can grow to fill the available space. If an item has a larger flex
                grow
                property than the other items, it will be bigger.</p>

            <h3>What is flex shrink?</h3>
            <p>Flex shrink determines if the flex item can shrink when the container shrinks, and how much. If the flex
                shrink property is larger on one item than the others, it will shrink more.</p>

            <h3>What is flex basis?</h3>
            <p>Flex basis sets the initial or ideal size of a flex item. If set to auto, it will look at the set height
                or
                width, or the size of the content. If set to 100%, it will take up the entire space of the parent
                container,
                either height or width depending on the main axis (row or column).
            </p>

            <h3>How do you make flex items arrange themselves vertically instead of horizontally?</h3>
            <p>You can arrange flex items vertically instead of horizontally by changing the rule on the flex container
                to
                <code>flex-direction: column</code>.
            </p>

            <h3>In a column flex-container, what does flex-basis refer to?</h3>
            <p>Flex basis will refer to the height of the flex item.</p>

            <h3>In a row flex-container, what does flex-basis refer to?</h3>
            <p>Flex basis will refer to the width of the flex item.</p>
            <h3>Why do the previous two questions have different answers?</h3>
            <p>When flex direction is set to column, the main axis is vertical and the cross axis is horizontal. When
                flex-direction
                set to row, the main axis is horizontal and the cross axis is vertical.</p>

            <h3>What is the difference between <code>justify-content</code> and <code>align-items?</code></h3>
            <p>Justify-content will organise the items along the main axis, and align-items organises them along the
                cross
                axis.</p>

            <h3>How do you use flexbox to completely center a div inside a flex container?</h3>
            <p>Use justify-content to center along the main axis and align-items to center along the cross axis.</p>

            <h3>What's the difference between justify-content: space-between and justify-content: space-around?</h3>
            <p>Space-between will organise items with even space between them, and space-around will organise items with
                even space between them AND on either side.</p>


            <h3>How can you use Flex to make a two-dimensional layout?</h3>
            <p>Create a two-dimensional layout with Flex by allowing your flex items to wrap.</p>
            <pre>
        <code>
            div {
                display: flex;
                flex-flow: row wrap;
            }
        </code>

            <h2>CSS Grid</h2>


            <h3>Why was CSS Grid introduced?</h3>
            <p>CSS Grid was introduced to allow finer grained control over layouts similar to magazine and newspaper
                layouts.</p>

            <h3>Which CSS layout module would you use to easily make equal sized items in a container?</h3>
            <p>It is easier to use CSS Grid because the size of the items is declared at the time of creating the grid,
                where flex children size is declared on the child itself.<br>
                It's also easier to use <code>fr</code> units to make all child items the same size.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2 id="create-grid">Creating a Grid</h2>

            <h3>How does an HTML element become a grid item?</h3>
            <p>An HTML element will become a grid item when it's parent is set to <code>display: grid</code>.</p>

            <h3>What is the space between lines on the grid?</h3>
            <p>The spaces between lines on the grid are the grid tracks.</p>

            <h3>How do you set gutters (also known as alleys) in the grid?</h3>
            <p>Gutters/alleys can be set by using the <code>gap</code> property.</p>

            <h3>Describe what happens when you have more content than defined tracks.</h3>
            <p>When there are more grid items than defined in the parent grid container, they create an <strong>implicit
                    grid</strong>.</p>

            <h3>How could you change the size for those undefined tracks?</h3>
            <p>Define the size of implicit grid items by giving the parent grid container a <code>grid-auto-rows</code>
                or <code>grid-auto-columns</code>
                property.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2 id="grid-position">Positioning Grid Elements</h2>

            <h3>Explain the difference between a track and a line.</h3>
            <p>A track is the actual content in a row or a column. A line is the divider between the rows and between
                columns.
            </p>

            <h3>What is the smallest unit on a grid?</h3>
            <p>The smallest unit on a grid is a cell. E.g. the content betwen row line 1 and 2 and column line 1 and 2
                is the first cell.</p>

            <h3>What kind of value do we give to the grid-column-start or grid-column-end properties?</h3>
            <p>These properties take single integer values e.g. <code>grid-column-start: 2</code> indicates the content
                will be positioned starting from column line 2.</p>

            <h3>Which property can we use to combine all the start and end values for a grid item?</h3>
            <p>We can combine all the start and end values to position a grid item with <code>grid-area</code>, which
                will take 4 integers divided by forward slashes to position the item, in this order: row start, column
                start, row end, column end.</p>
            <pre>
    <code>
        .item {
            grid-area: 1 / 1 / 3 / 4;
        }
    </code>            
</pre>

            <h3>Which grid container property can map out a visual structure of grid items?</h3>
            <p>The <code>grid-template-areas</code> property, set on a grid container, can create a visual structure of
                grid items, e.g.</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
        .container {
            grid-template-areas:
                header  header
                sidebar article
                footer  footer;
        }        
                </code>
</pre>

            <h2 id="grid-prop">Advanced Grid Properties</h2>

            <h3>How do you create several grid tracks of the same size without manually typing each one out?</h3>
            <p>Using the <code>repeat()</code> function, eg. <code>grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 200px)</code> will
                create 3 columns that are all 200px wide.</p>

            <h3>What is the difference between a static and dynamic size value?</h3>
            <p>A static value, such as <code>px</code> will remain that size at all times. A dynamic value, such as a
                percentage, <code>vw</code> or <code>fr</code> value, will change according to the size of the
                window/viewport.</p>

            <h3>
                How can you assign a grid track a flexible value that changes depending on the remaining space available
                in the grid?
            </h3>
            <p>The <code>fr</code> is a flexible value that can change based on the space available.
            </p>

            <h3>How can you assign grid tracks an uneven distribution of the remaining space in a grid?</h3>
            <p>By using the <code>fr</code> unit, eg. <code>grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr</code> will create 2 columns,
                with the second being twice the width
                of the first, regardless of the size of the container itself.
            </p>

            <h3>Which CSS functions will return the smallest or largest value supplied to them?</h3>
            <p>The <code>min()</code> function will return the smallest value passed to it, and the
                <code>max()</code> function will return the largest value passed to it.
            </p>

            <h3>
                Which CSS Grid-only function allows you to supply a minimum and maximum track size that is calculated in
                realtime?
            </h3>
            <p>The <code>minmax()</code> function, when passed to the <code>repeat()</code> function, can determine the
                smallest and largest value possible for an element which changes based on the size of the window or
                viewport.</p>
            <h3>
                Which global CSS function allows you to supply a minimum, ideal, and maximum value that is calculated in
                realtime?
            </h3>
            <p>The <code>clamp()</code> function takes three values in this order; the minimum size, ideal size, and
                maximum size. The appropriate size is calculated based on the size of the container or viewport as it is
                resized.</p>

            <h3>
                What attribute of repeat() can be used to fill in as many grid tracks as possible, given certain
                constraints?
            </h3>
            <p><code>auto-fill</code> can be used to continue to add items/cells to the grid as it is resized, even if
                they are empty.</p>

            <h3>What is the difference between auto-fit and auto-fill?</h3>
            <p><code>auto-fit</code> will fit the existing items into the available space, and will stretch them to fill
                the whole space. <code>auto-fit</code> does not change the size of existing items, but will add more
                items as soon as there is room for them.</p>

            <h2 id="flex-vs-grid">Flexbox vs Grid</h2>

            <h3>When might you use Flexbox over Grid?</h3>
            <p>Flexbox is useful for one dimensional layouts when you need to organise items in one row or column.</p>

            <h3>When might you use Grid over Flexbox?</h3>
            <p>Grid is more useful than Flexbox for complete layouts and more fine control over columns and rows at the
                same time.</p>

            <h3>When might you use the two of these tools together?</h3>
            <p>Grid items can be flex parents, and flex items can be grid parents.</p>
