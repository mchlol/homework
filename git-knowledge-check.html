            <h2>Intro to Git</h2>

            <h3>What kind of program is Git? </h3>
            <p>Git is a version control program, which tracks the changes that have been made to files. </p>

            <h3>
                What are the differences between Git and a text editor in terms of what they save and their record
                keeping?
            </h3>
            <p>A text editor can only save one copy of a file at a time. So if you wanted to keep copies of your file at
                different stages, you would literally need several copies of it. With Git, a ‘snapshot’ of your code is
                copied, so if you need to revert your changes you only need to refer to to the snapshot to restore it.
            </p>

            <h3>Does Git work at a local or remote level?</h3>
            <p>Git works at a local level, but you can push your git repository (collection of files) to a remote
                location.</p>

            <h3>Does GitHub work at a local or remote level? </h3>
            <p>Github is a service where you can store the remote copy of Git repository.</p>

            <h3>Why is Git useful for an individual developer?</h3>
            <p>
                Git is useful for an individual developer as you can track all the changes you’ve made, and if
                necessary,
                revert back to a previous state.
            </p>

            <h3>Why are Git and GitHub useful for a team of developers?</h3>
            <p>
                Git and Github are useful for a team as multiple people can work on the same file at the same time,
                using
                branches, and then merge their changes together.

            <h2>Git Basics</h2>

            <h3>How do you create a new repository on GitHub?</h3>
            <p>On the GitHub website, click on the + sign at the top right and select new repository.</p>

            <h3>How do you copy a repository onto your local machine from GitHub?</h3>
            <p>
                With your repo open on the GitHub website, click on the ‘code’ button and copy the SSH option. Back
                at
                the
                command line, navigate to your project folder and enter git clone
                <code>&lt;SSH link&gt;</SSH></code>
            </p>

            <h3>What is the default name of your remote connection?</h3>
            <p><code>origin</code></p>

            <h3>Explain what origin is in git push origin main.</h3>
            <p><code>origin</code> is the name of the remote connection to your repository on Github.</p>

            <h3>Explain what main is in git push origin main.</h3>
            <p><code>main</code> is the main (formerly known as master) branch of your code.</p>

            <h3>Explain the two-step system that Git uses to save files.</h3>
            <p>
                <code>git add</code> adds files to staging, then <code>git commit</code> commits the files to the
                branch
                you’re
                working on.
            </p>

            <h3>How do you check the status of your current repository?</h3>
            <p><code>git status</code></p>

            <h3>How do you add files to the staging area in git?</h3>
            <p><code>git add &lt;filename&gt;</code></p>

            <h3>How do you commit the files in the staging area and add a descriptive
                message?</h3>
            <p><code>git commit -m “&lt;essage&gt;”</code></p>

            <h3>How do you push your changes to your repository on GitHub?
                <p><code>git push origin &lt;branch name&gt;</code></p>

                <h3>How do you look at the history of your previous commits?
                    <p><code>git log</code></p>
        </section>

        <section id="messages">
            <h2>Commit Messages</h2>
            <h3>What are two benefits of having well-written commit messages and a good commit history? </h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Other developers will have a clear idea of what you have done with a file, and why.</li>
                <li>You may not always remember how or why you did something, so good commit messages also help you
                    understand what you have done, when viewing a project after a long time away from it.</li>
                <li>Having a good commit history means you will have a 'save point' to return to if something goes
                    wrong.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>How many characters should the subject line of your commit message be?</h3>
            <p>The subject line should be less than 50 characters, with a hard limit of 72.</p>
